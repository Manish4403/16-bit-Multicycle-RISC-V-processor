# 16-bit-Multicycle-RISC-V-processor
I have designed the datapath and tested using verilog on the FPGA board. R-type, I-type, B-type and S-type instruction format has been implemented in the design.The design was verified in Xilinx Vivado. Implemented on FPGA board Tech: Verilog, Xilinx Vivado. The design is tested with a program to find maximum number out of 10 random numbers. The assembly code is given below. The final output is coming after 220 clock cycles.
## The maximum frequency achieved is - 102 Mhz.
